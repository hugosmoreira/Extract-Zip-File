This is a Rust function that extracts the contents of a zip archive. The function expects a zip file name to be passed as the first argument when it is run in the command line.

The function first checks if the name of the zip file was passed as an argument. If not, it prints a usage message and returns an error code of 1.

Next, the function opens the zip file using the File struct from the fs module in the standard library. It then creates a ZipArchive instance using the ZipArchive struct from the zip crate.

The function then loops through the entries in the zip archive, extracting each one in turn. It prints a message for each file it extracts, indicating the name of the file and the number of bytes it contains.

If the zip file contains a directory, the function recursively creates the directory and its subdirectories. If the zip file contains a file, the function creates any necessary parent directories and then writes the file to disk.

The function also sets the permissions on the extracted files, if it is running on a Unix-based operating system.

Finally, the function returns a success code of 0.
